                <h3>More About Me!</h3>
                <p>I was born in Anchorage, Alaska but I don't claim any city as my home town I have consistently moved my location every 2-5 years. I believe that this has made me a person better able to adapt to new environments. This can be anything from starting a new school in a new city to a new job.

                </p>
                <p>In high school, I took an AP computer science test and passed the test with the highest score possible(5). Ever since then
                    I've known that I loved to create and code with technology. In that class, I learned python and some <abbr>HTML</abbr> which I plan to improve on during my future at Make School and Beyond.
                </p>
